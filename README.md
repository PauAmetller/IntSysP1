# Roll a ball exercise
After following the Unity Tutorial I applied some changes:
  1. _Added walls and ramps:_ To make the environment more complex and give the game some obstacles.
  2. _Added a second type of pickup:_ This second type has a diferent texture (only the color changes), which are located in the most difficult locations to go and give 2 point.
  3. _Changed the position and angle of the camera:_ So that the walls don't obtruct the sight while playing.
