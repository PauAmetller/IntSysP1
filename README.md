# Roll a ball exercise
After following the Unity Tutorial I applied some changes:
  1. **Added walls and ramps:** To make the environment more complex and give the game some obstacles.
  2. **Added a second type of pickup:** This second type has a diferent texture (only the color changes), which are located in the most difficult locations to go and give 2 point.
  3. **Changed the position and angle of the camera:** So that the walls don't obtruct the sight while playing.
